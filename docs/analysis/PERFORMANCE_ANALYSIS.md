# SPARQL Performance Analysis: Super Query vs Parallel+Join Approach

## Experiment Overview

This analysis compares the performance of two SPARQL query execution approaches:
- **Super Query**: Single complex query with 10 BGP patterns
- **Parallel+Join**: Three smaller subqueries executed in parallel, followed by result combination

**Dataset**: In-memory N3 store with 20 sensor entities  
**Engine**: Comunica SPARQL Engine  
**Methodology**: 35 total runs, excluding first 3 (warmup) and last 2 (cooldown) runs for analysis

## Statistical Analysis

### Performance Distribution
- **Super Query**: Mean = 45.22ms, Std Dev = 1.36ms (CV = 3.0%)
- **Parallel+Join**: Mean = 8.78ms, Std Dev = 0.98ms (CV = 11.2%)
- **Speedup Ratio**: Mean = 5.22x, Std Dev = 0.65x, Range = 4.31x - 6.58x

### Statistical Significance
- **t-statistic**: 107.48
- **p-value**: < 0.001 (highly significant)
- **Effect size**: Cohen's d = 30.17 (large effect)
- **Confidence Interval** (95%): 36.44 Â± 0.61 ms

### Consistency Analysis
- **Super Query**: Low variability (CV = 3.0%) - very consistent performance
- **Parallel+Join**: Moderate variability (CV = 11.2%) - some variation but still reliable
- **Winner Analysis**: Parallel approach wins 100% of runs (30/30)

## Key Findings

1. **Performance Advantage**: The parallel+join approach is **5.22x faster** on average than the super query approach.

2. **Statistical Significance**: The performance difference is highly significant (p < 0.001) with a large effect size.

3. **Consistency**: Both approaches show good consistency, with the super query being slightly more predictable.

4. **Practical Impact**: For this query pattern, breaking down complex queries into smaller parallel subqueries provides substantial performance benefits.

## Methodology Notes

- **Cache Clearing**: Each experiment run uses fresh QueryEngine instances with garbage collection enabled
- **Result Verification**: Both approaches return identical result counts (20 results)
- **Warmup/Cooldown Exclusion**: First 3 and last 2 runs excluded to eliminate initialization effects
- **Parallel Execution**: True parallel execution using Promise.all() for concurrent subquery processing
- **Join Simulation**: Realistic JOIN operation complexity based on result set sizes
